   - Create sound effects
  - Artists and track designer
   - Create additional tracks
   - Create additional artwork for tracks and background images
  - Developers

   - Extend the current web page and keep it up to date
  - Testers
   - For just about everything, especially different platforms and graphics cards
  - Writers
   - Write documentation, ranging from man page, to a description for the web, to a design document, etc...
