<!-- List of counters the achievements can query.
     The format to use is <name_of_the_counter value="X"/>
     where X is the desired value of the counter ;
     for example <won_races value="10"/>
     TODO : support asking for sum of values
     TODO : support logical relations (AND/OR) between values

    I - Won races (normal, time-trial, FTL) counters.
        Require to beat at least 3 AIs in any difficulty.

        won-races : total number of races won
        won-normal-races
        won-tt-races
        won-ftl-races

    II - Consecutive won races counters.
        These counters are reset if a race is restarted,
        or if a race is lost even if the AI count to increment
        is not met.

        cons-won-races
        cons-won-races-hard // This requires 5+ AIs and expert+ difficulty

    III - Race started and finished counters, by difficulty (linear races only)
        easy-started
        easy-finished
        medium-started
        medium-finished
        hard-started
        hard-finished
        best-started
        best-finished

    IV - Race started and finished counters, by game mode.
        Races against a ghost are counted both in the base mode counter,
        either time-trial or egg hunt, and in their own specific counter.

        normal-started
        normal-finished
        tt-started
        tt-finished
        ftl-started
        ftl-finished
        three-strikes-started
        three-strikes-finished
        soccer-started
        soccer-finished
        egg-hunt-started
        egg-hunt-finished
        with-ghost-started
        with-ghost-finished
        ctf-started
        ctf-finished
        ffa-started
        ffa-finished
        
    IV - Counters related to powerup use. The hit counters reference how many
        times the player kart has hit other karts, not how often it was hit.

        powerup-used
        powerup-used-1race
        bowling-hit
        bowling-hit-1race
        swatter-hit
        swatter-hit-1race
        all-hits // hits from bowling ball, cake and swatter
        all-hits-1race

    V - Counters related to other race events.

        banana // counts how many banana the player's kart has hit
        banana-1race
        skidding
        skidding-1race
        skidding-1lap -->
