  <!--  interval: How long a single bounce takes.
        max-height: The maximum height of a bounce.
        min-height: Unused mostly, but defines implicitly
                    the starting height (as average of
                    max and min height).
        target-distance: When the ball is closer than 
                    this to the target, it will aim
                    directly at the target.
        target-max-angle: Once the ball is aiming for its
                    target, it can at most change the angle
                    this much per second(!).
        time-between-balls:  Reduces the frequency with which rubber 
                    balls are found to 1 every 'timer' seconds.
        min-interpolation-distance: how far the control
                    points (which are center of squads)
                    must be from each other. A large value
                    allows smoother turning (no abrupt
                    change of direction), but a large
                    value can result in the ball being
                    off track (e.g. a value of 30 results
                    on the ramp in sand track that the 
                    ball goes to the left of the tunnel,
                    bouncing on the pyramid). Quite
                    catastrophal on the startrack and
                    skyline).
        squash-slowdown: How much karts that are 
                    squashed are slowed down.
        squash-duration: How long karts stay squashed.
        delete-timer: How long before the ball is removed
                    if no suitable target is found.
        early-target-factor: the rubber ball can use the
                    relative position of the kart to the
                    center of the track for improved targeting
                    (i.e. the ball will align its relative
                    position to the center of the track early).
                    This allows a lower target-distance to be
                    used since the ball is better aligned,
                    hopefully reducing the frequency of 
                    tunneling.

    <!-- This defines the number of karts for which there is a
       defined weight list. The value between two nodes will be
       interpolated as a linear average of the value at each node,
       except under the minimum node and above the maximum node
       (in which case it stays identical to the minimum/maximum node)

       The num of karts associated with each reference point should be
       sorted in ascending order to guarantee correct behavior.

       This doesn't apply to follow the leader, battle & tutorial weights
       If the max karts number is increased, think to add values for
       higher kart numbers. Otherwhise, it will default to value for 20. -->

  <!-- This defines the probabilities to get each type of item depending on
       the position of the kart.
       There are defined value for first kart, last kart, and
       at three equally spaced points between those.
       For example, with 5 karts those points will match positions 2, 3, 4.
       With 10 karts, they will correspond to 3,25 ; 5,5 ; 7,75.
       It is not an issue for it to be a float, as the weights for positions
       are linearly averaged.
       The order of items must correspond to powerup_manager.hpp.

       The first line (w1=...) corresponds to the weights of 
       getting a specific item, the second line (w-multi1) to 
       the weight at which it will yeld a triple item
       rather than a single one

       w1 corresponds to the weights at ref1, w2 to the weights at ref2, etc.
       When the number of karts in the race fall between refi and refj,
       the weights used are a weighted average between wi and wj.
       
       wf and w-multif are the weights associated with the follow-the-leader
       mode. Those are the same for all kart numbers.

       The probability to get an item is its weight divided by
       sum of weights of all items (single AND multi). It is recommended 
       to keep that sum equal to 200 to easily keep track of probabilities.

       'Global' items which affect all karts (switch, parachute) should
       be quite rare, since otherwise the item might be used
       too often (compared with many items which will only
       affect a karts or two).

       The distribution should give more similar items to different ranks
       when there are few karts, but have more important differences when
       there are more karts.                               -->
